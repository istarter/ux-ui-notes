# UX/UI Design 

### Theory UX Research
User experience research is the systematic investigation of your users in order to gather insights that will inform the design process. With the help of various user research techniques, you‚Äôll set out to understand your users‚Äô needs, attitudes, pain-points, and behaviors (processes like task analyses look at how users actually navigate the product experience‚Äînot just how they should or how they say they do). 

Typically done at the start of a project‚Äîbut also extremely valuable throughout‚Äîit encompasses different types of research methodology to gather both qualitative and quantitative data in relation to your product or service.
What is UX design? You scroll through a website or you tap on a button and something happens. I design what happens. or define yourself as a designer who simply understand your work: I design apps by doing research and what user needs.

### Points
1. Thougts create patterns
2. Patterns create actions and actions become behaviours
3. And behaviour can be studied. And the study of behaviour called pyschology. In UX it's called cognative science. 
### what is Cognative Pyschology? Cognitive Psychology ‚Äì Definition
The definition of cognitive psychology is deceivingly simple. Cognitive psychology is defined as the branch of psychology devoted to studying mental processes. What may not be so easy to grasp, though, is how many different types of mental processes there are and how people use them in their unique ways to draw conclusions and make decisions. Thus, cognitive psychology encompasses a very broad range of subjects.

- Thinking
- Reasoning
- Judgment
- Attention
- Mental imagery
- Language
- Recognizing numbers
- Memory
- Perception
- Creativity
- Forming concepts
- Making decisions
- Solving problems
- Making choices
- Meta-cognition (thinking about your thinking)
 
### Questions
1. Think about the UI why and how the UX designer distribute the space like the main content or a list, etc.

### UX Design Process
There are four UX design phases
1. User Research/Empathise: We discover users and thier needs here. frustration points, pain points
2. Define: We define users & associated feature set here.
3. Ideate: We draw, sketch, wireframe & design here.
4. Iterate: We test and iterate until we arrive at a greate design. 

### Empathise/User Research
Mindset of creating something that solove "User" problem and their "Needs". Two Major Methods to perform user research: 
1. Qualitative Research
2. Quantitative Research

***Quantitative Research:***
1. We prepare general and specific questionnaires. 2. We do quantitative research when we have minimum budget. We ask general/open ended questions from the client like what are you frustration point/pain point. We send the questionnaires to mass audience (Google, forms, Survey Monkey etc.)
3. We track the feedback & build a report on it by using google docs notion etc to present to the cleint. 
4. We drive conversations based on the finding and engage every possible stakeholder to be on the same page.

***Qualitative Research:***
1. User personas
  - Define personality: name, bio, behaviour, profession. We ll define a particular role of that person in the app.
  - Define Role: Is he using this app by an admin or a general user. 
  - Define Goals: What's his goal to achieve from this app like Ordering pizza is the goal and customer is the role who is using the app.
  - Define Motivations: what motivates the person by using this app for what pleasure he come. 
  - Define Frustrations: what things he get bored or feel frustration from the UX perspective.
  - Get to Specifics: what are the particular requirments for that app you are building. k ess app k lehaz se es user k personality myn kya hona chahye. personlity will be define for every app. like what's the specific of that app or business model ordering pizza that's the specific like requirment main features of the app.   
1. User Research/Empathise: The ability to understand someone elese feelings or thoughts in a situation. Empathy is a tool name. We track what you user say,think does and feels. We can conduct interviews to build an empathy map. We can create empathy map for one or a set of suers. We use the information that comes from emapthy mapping to define our personas.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11480617/182907472-687106fd-6bae-4432-8c64-a02775df3dd8.png)

 - Says
 - Thinks
 - Does
 - Feels
2. ***Define***
     1. When we get to this phase. We already have built an understanding about our users and thier needs.
     2. Now we need to start understanding our brand.
     3. What is the solution our brand / product is going to provide to satisfy the users and their needs.
     4. We define what needs to be done within the constraint of time & cost. 
     5. In the end of the define phase. We have closed requirements & expectations. Now we can get to ideat phase.

3. ***Ideate:*** We finally get to the cool part here. The Design.
   1. We draw user flows, paper sketches / Low fi skecteches.
   2. The valuable asset we produce in this phase is "Wireframes"
   3. Then we take the 'wires' and make high fidelity visual deisgns on tiop of it.
   4. We finally link each screen to prototype.
   5. Low fidility means sketches which draw by hand and high fidility are those which they high visuals. 

4. ***Iterate:*** Now, we have designed. It's time to give it a test drive.
   1. We send our prototypes to the stakeholders and users to test.
   2. We collect the information based on the feedback and reflect the feedback in the next iteration. 
   3. This process is repetitive until we finally arrive at a design.
   4. Iteration is part of the whole UX & UI process. 
5. Jobs to be done framework
6. User journey mapping: User journeys are the step by step journey that a user takes to reach thier goal. This journey will often consist of a number of website pages annd decision points that carry the user from one steop to another. 
![image](https://www.awesomescreenshot.com/image/31391754?key=4c3c05fc98a5f76a4fce4ead9bc5e961)
6. one to one user interviews (zoom, skype, google meet or in-person).
7. What is brain mapping: Let's say you have provided a scenario and trying to understand the scenario or I would simply say understand the whole idea of the client what can be done the client can correct your mistake or the whole idea what he wants. On the basis of Brain mapping we make a flow chart.

***What is sprint:*** A sprint is part of the core components of the agile methodology. The term refers to a predefined span of time in which a team will work to accomplish specific goals. This period may be any length, though sprints are usually fairly short (one or two weeks, for example).

### What makes a good design?
   1. Content is King: Content gives you the context. what is the information that you are designing for. It deponds what's the design about it like app for kids etc then you decide fonts for that. Ask content from the client to make clear the context to design it based on the infromation cient give you. 
   2. Layout: Do research on behance, dribble, pinterst now you have context. 
   3. Form or Shapes
   4. Colours
   5. Typography
   6. Images
   7. Space: Very very important. It's not about you plac e in a design its about what are the spaces you created. It's not about to take in, in the design it's about to take it out from the design and still it looks beautiful. 
   
  ### UI Rules
  
  - Header paragraph text: Text under the heading is called header paragraph text.
   
   
   
   
   
   

# Words of mouth
- Experimentation is the key in the desiging otherwise it won't improve. 
- Designers in vitnam
- Design muscles mean Analytical + visual design brings creativity not only visual design analytical thinking is important.
1. üî∂ Communicate the Value of Your Work
You're a designer, right?
You know that clients don't care about typefaces, gradients and kerning.
They hired you to take care of that stuff.
What they really want to know is how you can help them make more money.
And the best way to do that is by showing them how your design is going to make their business more efficient and increase profits.
2. ‚ô¶Ô∏è You have to know how your designs can make money
Here are some examples:
How does this design help users find what they're looking for faster?
How does this design bring in more leads?
How does this design bring in more donors?
3. üî∂ Position yourself as a business owner but be a creator
Take my example, I built my Instagram from 0 to 50K in 8 months, it made me $25,000 personally but generated $245,989 for my agency!
How? I established myself as a UI UX expert on Instagram, companies saw my valuable posts, saw my sponsored posts and offered me contracts which I redirected to my agency!
and agencies charge 3X compared to a normal freelancer,
provide more value and have systems built in!
4. üî∑ Delivering exceptional work!
This year, I worked with a Shopify SaaS product and we completely re-designed their decks, products, and brand! Our deck design helped the company close $5M in funding!!!
The owner had 16 friends whom she referred to me because they were asking, who did your deck!
- Design icon in the grid take 25/25 width height and icon must be in this grid.
- Fail fast -> learn fast -> improve fast
- Healthy Culture heal broken process. 

### Psychology of Diversity and Unconscious Bias


- ***Stereotypes***: Beliefs we hold about the attributes or characteristics that other groups are likely to have. In general, stereotypes lead to biases when the information is unclear/ambiguous. Stereotypes guide how we understand other people and their actions. 
- ***Prejudice***: Negative feelings people have about other groups. It has to do all with the negative reaction. 
- ***Descriminations***:Treating people differently based on the group that thery from. Descrimination is what people do their behaviour and actions towards people. 
- ***Unconscious Bias :*** Favoring those who have similar interests or backgrounds can lead to unconscious bias in recruitment. For example, a hiring manager prefers a job applicant who grew up in the same city.

### Jobs in the field of user experience
- There are many different kinds of UX designers: interaction designers, visual designers, and motion designers. Let's start with interaction designers, who focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions.
-  there are many different kinds of UX designers: interaction designers, visual designers, and motion designers. Let's start with interaction designers, who focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions. They figure out how to connect the users' needs and the business's goals with what's actually feasible to build. As an interaction designer at Google, my team and I are responsible for defining the user experience for security and privacy related tools. In my world, users always come first. There are also visual designers who focus on how a product or technology looks. They might be responsible for designing logos, illustrations, or icons. They may also decide font color and size, or work on product layouts. Motion designers are another common type of UX designer. They think about what it feels like for a user to move through a product and how to create smooth transitions between pages on an app or a website.
- Similar to UX designers, there are also graphic designers who create visuals that tell a story or message. Graphic designers usually work on the appearance of a physical product, like an invitation or a poster, while UX designers focus on how users interact with the product. Outside of design, there are many other roles in the field of UX. Collaboration is an important part of a UX designer's job. So let's talk about a few of the most common colleagues a designer might work with.
- UX researchers conduct the studies or interviews that help us learn how people use a product. Then there are UX writers, who think about how to make the language within a product clearer to make the user experience more intuitive. This could include writing labels for buttons or adjusting the tone to be formal or friendly. Next up, we have production designers, who often act as a bridge between interaction designers and engineers.

### The product development life cycle

Every new product, whether it‚Äôs an app or a physical object, follows a specific set of steps that take it from the first spark of an idea to the release of the final product. This is called the product development life cycle, and it has five stages: brainstorm, define, design, test, and launch. Depending on where you work, the exact names of each stage might be a little different, but the overall process is generally the same. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11480617/198214482-beb40b62-be45-4df4-9411-cb459883e707.png)

[The product development life cycle](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-user-experience-design/supplement/Otp7y/the-product-development-life-cycle")

- ***Brain storm:*** The first stage of the product development lifecycle is brainstorm. It's an active discovery stage that's all about generating ideas about the user and potential needs or challenges the user might have. During the brainstorm stage, the team generates ideas to solve a problem, understands the audience they're designing for, and identifies needs or challenges the audience may have. Research plays a key role in this first stage because you're exploring different ways to get to know the audience you're designing for. UX researchers and writers are often heavily involved in this stage, where the team might conduct interviews with potential users or conduct other research.
- ***Define***: The second stage in the product development lifecycle is define. Define is all about using the insights from the brainstorm stage and starting to narrow the focus. During the define stage, the team determines concrete ways that the product being developed will impact the user. As a UX designer, you'll begin to think more about specific details related to the product, who the product is for, what the product will do, and what features need to be included for the product to be successful. Statements that outline the goals or outline any problems you want to answer with the product design are the focus in the define stage.
- ***Design***: The third stage in the product development lifecycle is design. In the design stage, UX designers begin to actively develop ideas, and they also check that all specifications from the define stage are realistic. The first two stages are more about preparation and planning. They give you a clear understanding of who the user is, what the user wants, and which problems or challenges you want to address in your design. Using the insights from the first two stages, UX designers generate designs that keep the user top of mind. You'll create many different assets, including storyboards, which are sketches that help explore the user's experience, or wireframes, which provide outlines of the content layout. Or you might create prototypes, which are models that allow UX designers to test the functionality of a design. All of these things will be covered later in the program.
- ***Test***: The fourth stage is test. In the test stage, the team evaluates the product design based on feedback from potential users. Testing designs with users is really important because it helps the team focus on the user first and foremost and the designs second. Testing helps identify areas to refine or improve the designs. It also helps UX designers consider the interactivity of the design. This is a stage that involves lots of interaction between UX designers and front-end engineers as they figure out ways to create an end product that satisfies users' needs and is practical and functional. They discuss things like how the color or font can fit the company's brand or whether the prototype designs are easily understandable.
- ***Launch***: Finally, the last stage of the product development lifecycle is launch or sharing a finished version of the product with the public. This might involve listing an app in the Google Play Store or Apple's App Store, making a website go live, or putting a physical product on store shelves. Launching can be very satisfying for you and your team because you have the chance to understand how your designs will be received in the real world. However, the work on a product isn't quite finished after launch. You may still identify opportunities to improve on the designs or learn even more about the user experience based on feedback. This could involve going back to the design or testing stages and figuring out ways to produce a more enhanced version of the product. Now you've been introduced to the five stages in the product development lifecycle: brainstorm, define, design, test, and launch. Coming up, you'll learn about some of the characteristics of a good user experience. Meet you there.

### Characteristics of a good user experience
- Usable: The design, structure, and purpose of the product are clear and easy to use
- Equitable: The designs are helpful and marketable to people with diverse abilities and backgrounds
- Enjoyable: The design delights the user and fosters a positive connection with them by addressing user thoughts and feelings
- Useful: The design solves user problems

### Responsibilities of entry-level UX designers
- Researching: UX designers use research to understand audiences and learn about their backgrounds; demographics, like age and location; motivations; pain points; emotions; and life goals.
- wireframing: An entry-level designer also creates wireframes. A wireframe is an outline or a sketch of a product or a screen.
- prototyping: A UX designer will also create prototypes. A prototype is an early model of a product that demonstrates functionality, like a wireframe, but a lot more advanced. While a wireframe gives you a general idea of where things go and how the product will function, a prototype illustrates a progression from one screen to the next.
- creating information architecture: Another responsibility of an entry-level UX designer might include creating the information architecture, which is the framework of a website, or how it's organized, categorized, and structured. For example, when you click the File menu on a word processing application like Google Docs, you expect certain options, like New or Print, to appear in the dropdown menu. Or when you click on a company's homepage, you expect to find a link to an About page. That structure is the website's information architecture.
- communicating effectively
- Entry-level UX designers start their careers by doing a lot of tasks to learn the basics.

Generalist Designer: A UX designer with a broad number of responsiblities. 
A generalist might be responsible for a: 
- combination of user research,
- branding,
- user flows,
- UX writing,
- visual design,
- prototyping,
- production design,
- information architecture,
- and usability testing,
- among other things. Most generalists start their roles knowing about one or two of these topics.

- ***Who are my users?***: To reach as many users as possible, you‚Äôll consider questions such as these as part of your user research approach:

 - Do my users have impairments or disabilities to consider‚Äìwhether temporary, situational, or permanent?
 - How familiar are my users with technology?
 - How are my users accessing the product or service?
 - Where and when are my users accessing the product or service?
 - Have I considered all my potential users?

### Design Sprints
The goal of design sprints is to solve a critical design challenge through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users. At Google, we use design sprints to answer questions, define product directions, figure out cross-team strategies, and even build team culture. The Design Sprint is a proven methodology for solving problems through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users. Design Sprints quickly align teams under a shared vision with clearly defined goals and deliverables. Ultimately, it is a tool for developing a hypothesis, prototyping an idea, and testing it rapidly with as little investment as possible in as real an environment as possible.

- ***Understand***: In the Understand phase, you will create a shared knowledge base across all participants. Using the Lightning Talk method, knowledge experts across the business are invited to articulate the problem space from business, user, competitor, and technological angles.
- ***Define***: In the Define phase, the team evaluates everything they learned in the Understand phase to establish focus. This is done by defining specific context and desired outcomes of potential solutions. The phase concludes by choosing a specific focus for your Sprint, as well as goals, success metrics, and signals.
- ***Sketch***: In the Sketch phase, the Design Sprint team generates and shares a broad range of ideas as individuals. You will start by looking for inspiration, such as solutions in alternative spaces. Then, each Design Sprint participant will individually generate ideas for consideration. From there, the team will narrow down ideas as group to a single, well-articulated Solution Sketch per person.
- ***Decide***: In the Decide phase, the Design Sprint team finalizes the direction or concept to be prototyped. Each participant will share their Solution Sketch, and the team will find consensus on a single idea through decision-making exercises. The final direction will aim to address the Design Sprint focus.
- ****Prototype: In the Prototype phase, the Design Sprint team will work together to create a prototype of your concept. This is when many decisions are made around what exactly the concept is and includes. You will aim to create a prototype that is just real enough to validate, and you will do it really fast!

In the context of Design Sprint, we use the word ‚Äúprototype‚Äù in a slightly different way than in standard product development. A Design Sprint prototype is a facade of the experience you have envisioned in the Sketch phase. You are building just what you need to make the prototype real enough to get an authentic response from a potential user in the Validate phase. This means mapping out the exact flow for the experience and only building the steps you want to test. There is no need to build a full functional back-end or to solve for every flow in your product.

You can think of your prototype as an experiment in order to test out a hypothesis. This means you have to think critically about what you will build in order to get the feedback you need to validate or invalidate your hypothesis. Anything can be prototyped in a day if it is clearly mapped out.
- ***Validate***: In the Validate phase, the Design Sprint team will put your concept in front of users - this is your moment of truth! You will gather feedback from users who interact with your prototype, and if relevant, you will conduct stakeholder and technical feasibility reviews. You‚Äôll end your Sprint with a validated concept‚Äì or an invalidated concept to improve on. Either way, you‚Äôve made progress.

To recap the five phases of design sprints are: understand the scope of the design challenge, ideate possible solutions, decide on the most viable solution, create a workable prototype, and finally, test that prototype with actual users.

- Let's recap the sprint planning basics. To prepare for a design sprint, you'll need to conduct user research, schedule talks with experts, find the right space, gather supplies, establish ground rules, break the ice with your team, and plan out post-sprint action items. Sound about right? Awesome. Let's keep going. Up next, we'll walk through a design sprint brief.
