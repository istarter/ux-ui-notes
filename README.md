# UX/UI Design 

### Theory
What is UX design? You scroll through a website or you tap on a button and something happens. I design what happens. or define yourself as a designer who simply understand your work: I design apps by doing research and what user needs.

### Points
1. Thougts create patterns
2. Patterns create actions and actions become behaviours
3. And behaviour can be studied. And the study of behaviour called pyschology. In UX it's called cognative science. 
### what is Cognative Pyschology? Cognitive Psychology – Definition
The definition of cognitive psychology is deceivingly simple. Cognitive psychology is defined as the branch of psychology devoted to studying mental processes. What may not be so easy to grasp, though, is how many different types of mental processes there are and how people use them in their unique ways to draw conclusions and make decisions. Thus, cognitive psychology encompasses a very broad range of subjects.

- Thinking
- Reasoning
- Judgment
- Attention
- Mental imagery
- Language
- Recognizing numbers
- Memory
- Perception
- Creativity
- Forming concepts
- Making decisions
- Solving problems
- Making choices
- Meta-cognition (thinking about your thinking)
 
### Questions
1. Think about the UI why and how the UX designer distribute the space like the main content or a list, etc.

### UX Design Process
There are four UX design phases
1. User Research/Empathise: We discover users and thier needs here. frustration points, pain points
2. Define: We define users & associated feature set here.
3. Ideate: We draw, sketch, wireframe & design here.
4. Iterate: We test and iterate until we arrive at a greate design. 

### Empathise/User Research
Mindset of creating something that solove "User" problem and their "Needs". Two Major Methods to perform user research: 
1. Qualitative Research
2. Quantitative Research

***Quantitative Research:***
1. We prepare general and specific questionnaires. 2. We do quantitative research when we have minimum budget. We ask general/open ended questions from the client like what are you frustration point/pain point. We send the questionnaires to mass audience (Google, forms, Survey Monkey etc.)
3. We track the feedback & build a report on it by using google docs notion etc to present to the cleint. 
4. We drive conversations based on the finding and engage every possible stakeholder to be on the same page.

***Qualitative Research:***
1. User personas
  - Define personality: name, bio, behaviour, profession. We ll define a particular role of that person in the app.
  - Define Role: Is he using this app by an admin or a general user. 
  - Define Goals: What's his goal to achieve from this app like Ordering pizza is the goal and customer is the role who is using the app.
  - Define Motivations: what motivates the person by using this app for what pleasure he come. 
  - Define Frustrations: what things he get bored or feel frustration from the UX perspective.
  - Get to Specifics: what are the particular requirments for that app you are building. k ess app k lehaz se es user k personality myn kya hona chahye. personlity will be define for every app. like what's the specific of that app or business model ordering pizza that's the specific like requirment main features of the app.   
2. Empathy Mapping: The ability to understand someone elese feelings or thoughts in a situation. Empathy is a tool name. We track what you user say,think does and feels. We can conduct interviews to build an empathy map. We can create empathy map for one or a set of suers. We use the information that comes from emapthy mapping to define our personas.  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11480617/182907472-687106fd-6bae-4432-8c64-a02775df3dd8.png) - Says
 - Thinks
 - Does
 - Feels
4. Jobs to be done framework
5. User journey mapping: User journeys are the step by step journey that a suer takes to reach thier goal. This journey will often consist of a number of website pages annd decision points that carry the user from one steop to another.  ![Uploading image.png…]()

6. one to one user interviews (zoom, skype, google meet or in-person).
